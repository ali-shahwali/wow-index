<MudText Typo="Typo.h5">What is the rivalry system?</MudText>
<MudText Typo="Typo.body1">
    In this mode your guild and another guild of similar skill will face off in the latest raid.
    You will compete for the fastest clear time and move up in our leaderboards.
    <br />This is a completely different system from the race to world first and is therefor treated as such.
    If you are in a skilled guild with 10/10 progression in Castle Nathria we highly suggest you encourage your
    guild master to opt in to this game mode.
